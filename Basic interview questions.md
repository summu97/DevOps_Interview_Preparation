### What are your day to day activities as a **DevOps Engineer**
* I work closely with development teams to support daily build and deployment activities using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. My responsibilities include managing and updating infrastructure using Terraform, implementing and maintaining Kubernetes deployments, and making necessary changes to Jenkins pipelines based on project requirements. I regularly troubleshoot and resolve issues related to Kubernetes deployments, pod health, and CI/CD pipeline failures. Additionally, I monitor application and cluster status, support new feature requirements, and ensure reliable and smooth delivery across environments.
