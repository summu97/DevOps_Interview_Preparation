# The recommended Terraform lifecycle

```bash
terraform fmt → terraform init → terraform validate → terraform plan → terraform apply.
```

### What **terraform fmt** do?
> It Fixes indentation, Aligns arguments, Standardizes spacing

What terraform init do?
It Initializes the working directory, Downloads providers, Configures backend

What **terraform validate** do?
It validates Terraform configuration files for Syntax errors, Invalid argument names, Type mismatches, Missing required variables
Ensures modules and providers are valid (after init)

What terraform plan do?
It Creates an execution plan.
- It Compares:
  * Terraform configuration
  * Terraform state
  * Real infrastructure
And Shows:
  * What resources will be **created**
  * What will be **updated**
  * What will be **destroyed**

What terraform apply do?
It Creates / updates / deletes real resources
* **After successful execution**, Terraform:
  * Creates `terraform.tfstate` (local backend)
  * OR updates remote state (Azure Storage, S3, GCS, etc.)

When is the `.tfstate` file created?
The **`.tfstate` file is created during `terraform apply`**


What `terraform plan -out=tfplan` do?
* Saves the execution plan to a file
* Used for approval-based pipelines

What `terraform refresh` do?
It Updates state from real infrastructure
* Requires state to already exist

# Terraform Internal Files

---

## 1️⃣ `.terraform/` Directory

### ✅ When is `.terraform/` created?

👉 During: terraform init

---

### 📂 What is inside `.terraform/`?

**Key contents:**

* Downloaded providers
* Downloaded modules
* Backend initialization data
* Provider binaries (OS-specific)

**Important notes:**

* Environment-specific
* Safe to delete and re-create
* Must be added to `.gitignore`

---

## 2️⃣ `.terraform.lock.hcl`

### ✅ When is `.terraform.lock.hcl` created?

👉 During `terraform init`

Specifically when:

* A provider is downloaded for the first time
* Provider versions change

---

### 📄 What is inside `.terraform.lock.hcl`?

Example:

```hcl
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm" {
  version     = "3.70.0"
  constraints = "~> 3.0"
  hashes = [
    "h1:abc123...",
    "zh:xyz456..."
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔹 Contains:

* Exact provider versions
* Provider source registry
* Checksum hashes for integrity verification

---

### 📌 Git Best Practices

| File                  | Commit to Git             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `.terraform/`         | ❌ No                      |
| `.terraform.lock.hcl` | ✅ Yes                     |
| `.tfstate`            | ❌ No (use remote backend) |

How to unlock terraform lock?
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID

❓ What problems occur if the state file is lost or corrupted?
✅ 1. Terraform “forgets” what it manages
If the state file is missing or corrupted, Terraform no longer knows which resources it has already created. So when you run terraform plan or apply, Terraform may try to re-create resources that already exist, because it thinks they don’t exist yet. This can lead to:
Duplicate infrastructure
Conflicts with unique resource names
Errors from the cloud provider

9. How does **state locking** work?
Terraform state locking prevents multiple users or pipelines from modifying the same state file at the same time.
Terraform automatically acquires a lock before updating state and releases it after the operation, preventing state corruption and concurrent writes.

10. What happens if two users run `terraform apply` at the same time?
If two users run terraform apply at the same time, Terraform state locking allows only one operation to proceed.
The second user’s apply will fail or wait until the state lock is released, preventing state corruption and conflicting changes.

11. Explain `terraform state list`, `mv`, `rm`, and `pull`.
🔹 terraform state list
Lists all resources currently tracked in the Terraform state file.
Used to see what Terraform is managing in the current workspace.

🔹 terraform state mv
Moves or renames a resource inside the state file only.
Used when refactoring code (renaming resources or moving them into modules) without recreating infrastructure.

🔹 terraform state rm
Removes a resource from the state file only, not from real infrastructure.
Terraform will stop managing that resource, but it will continue to exist in the cloud.

🔹 terraform state pull
Downloads and displays the current state file from the backend.
Used for backup, inspection, or debugging of remote state.
---
14. Can you use multiple providers in one Terraform project?
Yes ✅ — you can use multiple providers in a single Terraform project.
Terraform allows defining multiple providers (even multiple configurations of the same provider) and assigning them to different resources or modules using provider aliases.

16. What happens if a provider version changes?
If a provider version changes, Terraform will download the new version during terraform init and update .terraform.lock.hcl.
Depending on the change, it may introduce new features, behavior changes, or breaking changes, which can affect plan and apply, so provider upgrades should be tested carefully.
---


18. Difference between:

* `terraform.tfvars`
* `*.auto.tfvars`
.tfvars files: Only terraform.tfvars is auto-loaded. Other files like dev.tfvars or qa.tfvars must be passed explicitly using -var-file.
.auto.tfvars files: All files ending with .auto.tfvars in the current directory (like dev.auto.tfvars, qa.auto.tfvars) are automatically loaded and merged.


---

## 5️⃣ Modules

21. What is a **Terraform module**?
22. Difference between:

* Root module
* Child module
main.tf (or the files in your project root directory) is the root module.
Any folder you create like modules/vnet, modules/vm, etc., which is called from the root module using the module block, is a child module.
Root module = entry point, Child module = reusable component called by root.

23. How do you version Terraform modules?
“Modules are versioned using either the Terraform Registry version argument, Git tags with ref, or branches; using tags or registry versions is best for stable, reproducible deployments.”
Terraform Registry:

module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.15.0"
}


Locks the module to a specific release.

Git repository with tags:

module "app" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/myorg/terraform-modules.git//app?ref=v1.2.0"
}


Uses a Git tag to fix the module version.

Avoid using branches for production because they can change unexpectedly.


24. What are **module inputs and outputs**?
Module Inputs

Definition: Variables that you pass into a module to configure it.

Purpose: Make modules reusable and flexible.

Example:
# modules/app/variables.tf
variable "instance_type" {
  type    = string
  default = "t2.micro"
}

# modules/app/main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}


Module Outputs

Definition: Values that a module exports to the parent module or root configuration.

Purpose: Share important information like resource IDs, IPs, or ARNs.

Example:
# modules/app/outputs.tf
output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.app.id
}

# root/main.tf
output "app_instance_id" {
  value = module.app.instance_id
}



25. When should you not use modules?
For very small or simple configurations
If your Terraform code is only a few resources, modules add unnecessary complexity.
When you don’t need reusability
Modules are mainly for reusable code. If resources are one-off and not shared, a module may be overkill.
For highly dynamic or unique resources
If resources vary greatly and can’t be parameterized easily, creating a module can make the code harder to maintain.

---

## 6️⃣ Meta-Arguments & Expressions

26. Difference between:

* `count` :
* `for_each`
"count is for multiple identical resources; for_each is for multiple resources with different attributes or keys."

27. When would you prefer `for_each` over `count`?
28. What is `depends_on`?
29. Explain **dynamic blocks**.
30. What are **Terraform functions**? Name a few you’ve used.

31. What is the **lifecycle block**?
32. Explain:

* `create_before_destroy`
* `prevent_destroy`
* `ignore_changes`
replace_triggered_by

---


35. Difference between:

* Workspaces
* Separate state files
“Workspaces are logical partitions of a single backend with limited isolation, while separate state files/backends give full isolation and are safer for production environments.”

36. Do you recommend workspaces for prod? Why or why not?
Workspaces are fine for dev or staging, but not recommended for production because they share the same backend and increase risk of accidental changes. Use separate backends/configurations for production instead.
1️⃣ Applying to the wrong workspace
Example: You meant to apply changes in dev but are currently in prod workspace.
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply


2️⃣ Sharing backend between multiple environments
Workspaces share the same backend (e.g., S3 bucket).
Accidentally pointing prod workspace to a backend containing dev state can overwrite production state.

Someone might by mistake change prod state etc.....

---

39. How do you scan Terraform code for security issues?
“Scan Terraform code for security issues using tools like tfsec, Checkov, or terrascan, and integrate them into CI/CD pipelines to catch misconfigurations before deployment.”
| Tool          | Description                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **tfsec**     | Scans Terraform code for security misconfigurations (AWS, Azure, GCP).   |
| **Checkov**   | CI/CD friendly tool to detect cloud security misconfigurations.          |
| **terrascan** | Scans IaC templates against compliance rules and best practices.         |
| **KICS**      | Detects misconfigurations in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, etc. |

EX: 
# Scan Terraform files in current directory
tfsec .


40. What is **Terraform Drift**?
“Terraform Drift happens when real infrastructure changes outside Terraform, causing the state file and actual resources to mismatch; it can be detected with terraform plan and fixed with terraform apply or state updates.”
---

# 🔹 Scenario-Based Terraform Interview Questions (VERY IMPORTANT)

These are **must-prepare** for a 4+ year engineer.

---

## 🔥 Scenario 1: State Conflict

**Q:**
Two engineers ran `terraform apply` at the same time and state got corrupted.
👉 How would you prevent this and how would you fix it?

**Expected areas:**

* Remote backend
* State locking (S3 + DynamoDB / Azure Blob + Lease)
* `terraform state pull`
* State recovery strategy
“To prevent state corruption, always use a remote backend with state locking (S3 + DynamoDB or Azure Blob + Lease). If state is corrupted, pull the state with terraform state pull, restore from backup, or repair manually using state commands before re-applying.”
terraform state pull > state_backup.tf
Pulls the current state into a local backup file.

Restore from backup

If you have a recent backup of your state, restore it to the remote backend.

Manually repair state (if needed)

Use commands like:

terraform state list        # See resources in state
terraform state rm <res>   # Remove corrupted entries
terraform import <res> ... # Re-import real resource into state


Re-run terraform plan and apply

After restoring or fixing the state, validate with a plan before applying.
---
=======================
## 🔥 Scenario 2: Resource Accidentally Deleted

**Q:**
A resource was manually deleted from the cloud console. What happens during the next `terraform apply`?

**Follow-ups:**

* How do you detect drift?
* How do you re-create vs ignore the resource?

Here’s a **clear, interview-ready answer** in question-and-answer format:

---

### ❓ Scenario: Resource manually deleted from the cloud console

If a resource managed by Terraform is **manually deleted** outside Terraform (e.g., via AWS/Azure console), then:

* During the next `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`, Terraform will **detect that the resource is missing**.
* Terraform will plan to **re-create the resource** to match the declared configuration in the `.tf` files.

---

### ❓ How do you detect drift?

* **Terraform automatically detects drift** by comparing the **Terraform state** with the **real infrastructure**.
* Commands to detect drift:

```bash
terraform plan
# Shows resources that are missing, changed, or out-of-sync
```

```bash
terraform refresh
# Updates the state file to match real infrastructure without making changes
```

* Example output:

```
# aws_instance.web has been deleted outside Terraform
-/+ destroy and create replacement
```

---

### ❓ How do you re-create vs ignore the resource?

1. **Re-create the resource (default behavior):**

   * Simply run:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   * Terraform will recreate the deleted resource to match the configuration.

2. **Ignore the resource:**

   * Use the `lifecycle` block with `ignore_changes` or `prevent_destroy`:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true     # Terraform will fail if it tries to destroy
    ignore_changes  = [tags]  # Ignore specific attributes if changed outside
  }
}
```

* If the resource is deleted but you want Terraform to **ignore it completely**, you can also **remove it from the state**:

```bash
terraform state rm aws_instance.web
```

> Terraform will stop managing it and **won’t try to re-create it**.

---

### ✅ Interview One-liner

> “If a resource is manually deleted, Terraform detects it as drift and plans to re-create it. You can detect drift with `terraform plan` or `terraform refresh`, re-create it with `terraform apply`, or ignore it using `lifecycle` blocks or removing it from the state.”


---

## 🔥 Scenario 3: Renaming a Resource

**Q:**
You renamed a Terraform resource block and now Terraform wants to destroy and recreate it.
👉 How do you avoid downtime?

**Expected answer:**

* `terraform state mv` : # Move state so Terraform knows it's the same resource
terraform state mv aws_instance.web_old aws_instance.web_new

* Resource mapping
When moving resources between modules or workspaces, you can also map old state to new module paths: terraform state mv aws_instance.web_new module.app.aws_instance.web

* Lifecycle handling
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
  }
---

## 🔥 Scenario 4: Multiple Environments (Dev / QA / Prod)

**Q:**
How would you design Terraform for **multiple environments**?

**Expected approaches:**

* Separate state per environment
* Backend config
* Folder structure
* CI/CD driven environment selection

---

## 🔥 Scenario 5: Zero-Downtime Deployment

**Q:**
You need to update a VM or Load Balancer without downtime.
👉 How do you handle this in Terraform?

**Expected topics:**

* `create_before_destroy`
* Blue-Green / Rolling strategies
* Integration with autoscaling groups / MIGs / VMSS



Here’s the **question and answer format** for Terraform deployment strategies:

---

### ❓ Can you implement Blue-Green or Rolling deployment strategies in Terraform?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can, but Terraform **does not have built-in deployment strategies**. You achieve them by structuring your infrastructure and updates carefully, often combined with CI/CD tools or load balancers.

---

### ❓ How can you implement Blue-Green deployments in Terraform?

**Answer:**

* Maintain **two sets of resources** (Blue and Green).
* Use **DNS or load balancer** to route traffic to one environment.
* Deploy new versions to the idle environment, then **switch traffic**.

**Example:**

```hcl
module "app_blue" {
  source  = "./app"
  version = "1.0"
}

module "app_green" {
  source  = "./app"
  version = "2.0"
}
```

---

### ❓ How can you implement Rolling deployments in Terraform?

**Answer:**

* Update resources **gradually in batches** using `count`, `for_each`, or `-target`.
* Apply changes incrementally to subsets of resources.

**Example:**

```bash
terraform apply -target=module.app[0]
terraform apply -target=module.app[1]
```

---

### ❓ Key Notes

**Answer:**

* Terraform handles **infrastructure provisioning**, not traffic shifting.
* CI/CD tools or load balancers are used for traffic management.
* Modules, workspaces, and state targeting help safely apply updates gradually.

---


## 🔥 Scenario 6: Terraform in CI/CD

**Q:**
How do you run Terraform in a CI/CD pipeline securely?

**Expected points:**

* Remote backend
* Service principals / IAM roles
* `terraform plan` approval
* Separate apply stage
* No local state

---

## 🔥 Scenario 7: Module Design

**Q:**
You are asked to create a reusable VPC module.
👉 What inputs, outputs, and validations would you add?

**Expected areas:**

* Variables with validation
* Outputs for IDs
* Versioning
* Readme & examples

---

## 🔥 Scenario 8: Breaking Change in Provider

**Q:**
After upgrading a provider version, Terraform plan shows massive changes.
👉 What steps do you take?

**Expected answer:**

* Provider version pinning
* Changelog review
* `terraform init -upgrade`
* Testing in lower environments

---

## 🔥 Scenario 9: Large Terraform Codebase

**Q:**
Your Terraform apply takes 45 minutes. How do you optimize it?

**Expected ideas:**

* Split states
* Reduce dependencies
* Parallelism
* Targeted applies (carefully)

Here’s the **question and answer format** for Terraform parallelism:

---

### ❓ Does Terraform support parallelism?

**Answer:**
Yes, Terraform supports **parallelism**, which allows multiple resources to be created, updated, or deleted at the same time, speeding up deployments.

---

### ❓ How do you control parallelism in Terraform?

**Answer:**
Use the `-parallelism` flag with `terraform apply` or `terraform plan`:

```bash
terraform apply -parallelism=10
```

* Default is 10.
* Terraform will still respect **resource dependencies**.

---

### ❓ Why use or limit parallelism?

**Answer:**

* **Use it** to speed up deployment of independent resources.
* **Limit it** to avoid API rate limits or conflicts when deploying many resources simultaneously.

---

**Interview one-liner:**

> “Terraform supports parallelism to deploy multiple resources concurrently, controlled via `-parallelism`, while respecting dependencies to ensure safe execution.”

---

## 🔥 Scenario 10: Secrets Handling

**Q:**
How do you pass database passwords to Terraform securely?

**Expected solutions:**

* Vault
* Azure Key Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / GCP Secret Manager
* Environment variables
* Avoid plaintext tfvars

44. How do you refactor Terraform without downtime?
Refactor simply means restructuring or reorganizing your code/configuration without changing its behavior.
Moving resources from main.tf into a module
Renaming variables or resources for clarity
Splitting a large file into smaller, logical files

❓ How to Refactor Terraform Without Downtime

Move resources in state first – use terraform state mv so Terraform knows resources already exist.
Don’t recreate resources – rename or reorganize carefully.
Use modules safely – move resources into modules gradually.
Test in dev/staging – never apply big changes directly to production.
Plan first – run terraform plan to check changes.
Apply step by step – make small incremental changes.
Optional: use -target to apply specific resources first.

One-liner:
“Refactor Terraform by moving resources in state, testing in dev, planning carefully, and applying changes gradually to avoid downtime.”

45. How do you manage **cross-account / cross-subscription** deployments?
Use provider aliasing to define multiple accounts/subscriptions and assign the correct provider to each resource or module.
